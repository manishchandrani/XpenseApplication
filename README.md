Xpense - Your Friendly Expense Management App
About Xpense
Welcome to Xpense! We created this app to make managing shared expenses with friends, family, and colleagues as simple and hassle-free as possible. No more confusion about who owes what—Xpense helps you keep everything organized in one place!

## Meet the Team
This project is the result of collaboration between:

Manish Chandrani
Naveena Kandasamy Rajkumar
We developed Xpense as part of our Human-Computer Interaction class at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and we’re excited to share it with you!

## What Xpense Can Do
Intuitive Design: We focused on creating a user-friendly interface, so you can navigate effortlessly.
Expense Tracking: Easily keep track of who paid for what and who owes you.
Bill Splitting Made Easy: Quickly split bills among your group without the math headaches!
Debt Settling: Settle up in a few taps—no more awkward conversations about money.
History Log: Keep a record of past expenses for future reference.
Design Tools
We brought our vision to life using Figma, where you can check out our designs and user flows.
